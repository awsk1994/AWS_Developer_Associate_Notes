# S3

## Section Introduction

* One of the main building blocks of AWS
* advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
* Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
* Many AWS Services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well

### S3 Use Cases
* Backup and Storage
* Disaster Recovery
* Archive
* Hybrid Cloud Storage
* Media Hosting
* Data Lakes & Big Data Analytics
* Software Delivery
* Static Website

* NasDaq stores 7 years of data in S3 Glacier

### Buckets
* S3 allows people to store "Objects" (files) in "Buckets" (directories)
* Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* S3 looks like a global service, but buckets are created in a region
* Naming Convention
    * no uppercase, no underscore
    * 3-63 characters long
    * Not an IP
    * Must start with lower case, or number
    * Must not Start with the prefix `xn--` nor `-s3alias`

### Objects
* Objects (files) have a key
* Key is the FULL PATH:
    * s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
    * s3://my-buckets/folder1/folder2/my_file.text
* Object values are the content of the body
    * Max Object size = 5TB (5000GB)
    * if uploading more than 5GB, need use "multi-part upload"

* Metadata (list of key/value pairs, system or user metadata)
* Tags (Unicode key/value pair - up to 10) - useful for security/lifecycle
* Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## Security

* User-Based
    * IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
* Resource-Based
    * Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    * Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
    * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)
* Note: an IAM Principal can access an S3 if:
    * User IAM Permissions ALLOW it **OR**the resource policy ALLOWS it
    * **AND** there's no explicit DENY
* Encryption
    * encrypt objects in S3 using encryption keys

### S3 Bucket Policies
* JSON based policies
    * Resources: buckets and objects
    * Effect: Allow/Deny
    * Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
    * Principal: the account or user to apply the policy to
* Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    * Grant public access to the bucket
    * Force objects to be encrypted at uploda
    * Grant access  to another account (cross account)

### Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

* These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
* if you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on.
* can be set at account level
